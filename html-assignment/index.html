                <p>Hey there, I'm a passionate videographer who has a love for creative ideas and web development.
                    I am very into designing websites and other stuff. I am a big soccer fan and my favorite player is
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Messi"><b>Lionel Messi</b></a>. He is the best soccer 
                    player in history and there might be no other player that can reach the same level as him for a few
                    decades. He holds the <mark>1<sup>st</sup></mark> position in most goals and assist ratio, staggering at a
                    whopping 105 goals and assists in the 2011-2012 season, and most top players nowadays combined only 
                    score less than 50. I love watching and playing soccer because it helps me relax and chill after a 
                    long day.</p>

                    <div>
                        <p>Another part of me loves tech and video games. I'm a big fan of new tech launches and video games. 
                        I'm always watching what's new and I love to compare specs. I love cameras, servers, PCs, phones, and more. 
                        My favorite tech YouTuber is <b>Marques Brownlee</b> aka 
                        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/marquesbrownlee"><b>MKBHD</b></a>. He reviews a variety of cool tech products.</p>
